Call Me Out!

Hate speech has become a pervasive problem in today's society, with its potential to spread negativity, fuel conflicts, and incite violence. Therefore, detecting and preventing hate speech has become a crucial task. Machine learning techniques have proved to be an effective tool in hate speech detection. These algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns and classify content based on predefined criteria. By automating the detection process, machine learning can save time, effort and resources compared to manual methods. Furthermore, machine learning models can learn and adapt over time, improving their accuracy and efficiency in identifying and filtering hate speech. Therefore, the application of machine learning techniques in hate speech detection has become a relevant area of research with the potential to make a significant impact in promoting a safer and more inclusive online environment.

The “Call me sexist but” data set consists of  16,914 annotated tweets collected over a 2 months period. 

3,383 of those tweets were flagged for sexist content sent by 613 users, 1,972 for
racist content sent by 9 users, and 11,559 for neither sexist or racist and is sent by 614 users.

The purpose of this project is to use this dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the hate speech landscape on Twitter. 
To accomplish this, we will apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to detect instances of hate speech in the dataset. By doing so, we hope to shed light on the prevalence of hate speech on social media platforms and better understand the specific types of language and behavior that constitute hate speech. Ultimately, this research could inform the development of more effective strategies for combating hate speech online and promoting more inclusive and respectful communication in digital spaces.
